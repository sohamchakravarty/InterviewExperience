- We want to build a parking lot management application. Multiple parking lots want to use this application.
- Application should cater to multiple parking lots
- There are two types of vehicles: Two-Wheeler, Car
- Each parking lot has separate capacity for each kind of vehicle. For example: 20 car spots and 50 bike spots at lot A.
- There are different rate cards for each kind of vehicle.
- For example,
	- 2 wheelers: 0-2h : Rs 20, 2-4h: Rs 50, 4h-1d: Rs 80, >1d - 80 per day
	- 4 wheelers: 0-1h: Rs 30, 1-3h: Rs 70, 3h-1d: Rs 100, >1d - 100 per day

The application should have the following features:
- Register a parking lot with its capacities and rate card.
- Park a Vehicle at a given parking lot (should fail if the lot is full)
- Exit from the parking area and tell the amount due for the duration.
- Given a vehicle no., see complete parking history (Lot, Duration, Amount Paid)
 

Expectations:
- You are free to use any programming language. You can write a CLI, a HTTP API, or even just methods that you call and demonstrate in a wrapper program.
- You will program on your own machine. Please ensure you have your IDE or development environment set up.
- You have access to documentation and all of the internet
- Focus on building a working demo first.
- Good code structure and modelling is a plus
- Database is optional. Wouldn’t recommend setting up a db, it takes a lot of time. In memory stores or flat files are fine.
